The  Health Promotion Assessment requires students to create a 2000-word online health promotion resource using the Sway platform. The focus is on applying health promotion theory and methods to address a public health issue. 
Students can choose between an existing or hypothetical intervention and must demonstrate a critical understanding of theoretical foundations, ethical dimensions, and the value of health promotion in addressing inequalities. 
The resource should be tailored for health promotion professionals, presenting a convincing and evidence-based plan. 
Additionally, a 10-minute reflective video must address specific questions related to the chosen public health issue and the created intervention.
